[02:18] Tutor (Marena keys): Hi, how are you?
[02:30] Tutor (Marena keys): Um, let me know if you're able to hear me. Um, you could just type in the chat or unmute yourself.
[02:51] Student (Jesse): Wait, what did you say? My fault.
[02:54] Tutor (Marena keys): Um, are you able to hear me? I guess you are now.
[02:58] Tutor (Marena keys): Um, could you share your screen so I can see what you're working on today?
[03:01] Student (Jesse): Yeah. I'm almost done. I just gotta finish this, but this is low-key confusing.

[03:09] Student (Jesse): Oh, this is easy.
[03:11] Tutor (Marena keys): Huh?
[03:12] Student (Jesse): No, it's confusing.
[03:14] Student (Jesse): Oh, it's confusing. Oh, okay.
[03:16] Tutor (Marena keys): Um, yeah, we can work through this problem together. Um...
[03:24] Tutor (Marena keys): Okay. A baseball field... there is 60 feet between the pitcher and third base.
[03:29] Tutor (Marena keys): 90 feet between the catcher and third base.
[03:31] Background: Okay, so...
[03:40] Tutor (Marena keys): Okay.
[03:42] Tutor (Marena keys): How far is the distance between the pitcher and the catcher?
[03:45] Student (Jesse): Oh, okay. Yeah, so this is the, um, Pythagorean theorem.
[03:50] Tutor (Marena keys): Have you all discussed it in class?
[03:52] Student (Jesse): Yeah.
[03:53] Tutor (Marena keys): Okay. So they want you to find b. Um, so then you know that a squared plus b squared equals c squared.
[04:07] Student (Jesse): Mhm.
[04:08] Tutor (Marena keys): Is it that same one for this one? Or is it a squared plus c squared?
[04:15] Tutor (Marena keys): Um, so you would have to do like 90 squared plus 60 squared and then take the square root of that.
[04:26] Tutor (Marena keys): Um, yeah, I don't have a calculator right now, but...
[04:32] Student (Jesse): I don't know what the actual number is.
[04:36] Student (Jesse): It says 107.7. I don't see that anywhere.
[04:39] Tutor (Marena keys): Oh no, and then 32, you gotta... oh yeah, okay.
[04:46] Tutor (Marena keys): Just find an estimate and then round to the nearest tenth. So it's four...
[04:56] Tutor (Marena keys): So you'd be doing 90 squared plus 60 squared.
[05:07] Tutor (Marena keys): And then take the square root of that.
[05:14] Tutor (Marena keys): Um...
[05:15] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah, I don't calculate what the actual number is.
[05:22] Student (Jesse): Wait, what?
[05:27] Student (Jesse): Wait, so is a equal...?
[05:30] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah, I'm also confused why it's not one of the choices.
[05:43] Tutor (Marena keys): Because it makes sense to do like 60 squared plus 90 squared but I don't know why that's not one of the choices.

[07:45] Tutor (Marena keys): Okay. Yeah, this is also confusing.
[07:48] Tutor (Marena keys): Um... the way they describe it is so weird but...
[08:05] Student (Jesse): So 10 and 10 is 100, then 8 times 8 is 64. That equals 36. Wait no, I gotta subtract.
[08:12] Student (Jesse): Oh yeah, wait, I did subtract. 36. Yeah I don't get this one.

[10:17] Student (Jesse ravera): Okay.
[10:19] Student (Jesse ravera): Um... this one doesn't seem too bad.
[10:22] Student (Jesse ravera): 'Cause I think they're just asking...
[10:33] Student (Jesse ravera): 'Cause width, it would be the green line at the bottom.
[10:37] Tutor (Marena keys): Right. And then you can find the other one.
[10:40] Student (Jesse ravera): Um... so you would have like...
[10:43] Student (Jesse ravera): 48 squared plus... b squared equals 60 squared.
[10:51] Student (Jesse ravera): Or... and you'd have to solve for B. And then from that...
[10:58] Student (Jesse ravera): It would be... like that B squared plus something else equals 45 squared?
[11:06] Student (Jesse ravera): It's just like two steps. I don't know if there's a...
[11:51] Background: So maybe you could ask them to either slow down or type...
[12:10] Background: The trucker needs to know if his trailer is wide enough for his load...
[12:17] Student (Jesse ravera): It's just the bottom green that you're trying to solve.
[12:22] Student (Jesse ravera): But it's like two steps that you have to do.
[12:26] Background: He knows the diagonal width is 45... is the measurements...
[12:30] Student (Jesse ravera): Wait I got the problem wrong because I did it wrong.
[12:35] Background: Okay. So I could find the height by doing the blue triangle.
[12:39] Student (Jesse ravera): Alright.
[12:40] Background: And then I can use the height and the green triangle...
[12:45] Background: To get the width of the truck.
[12:47] Student (Jesse ravera): Okay.
[13:28] Student (Jesse ravera): So I did this...
[13:30] Background: Did you do minus?
[13:32] Student (Jesse ravera): Yeah.
[13:32] Background: Because height has to be smaller than the 60.
[13:35] Student (Jesse ravera): 1296. So it's 36 is the height.
[13:40] Student (Jesse ravera): So then I just solve it?
[13:41] Background: And now I'm gonna do 46 squared take away 30 squared... Wait, 45 squared take away 36 squared to get the base...
[13:49] Background (Jesse ravera): Is that the one they're wanting you to do?
[13:50] Student (Jesse ravera): I think so.
[13:54] Background: Yeah. They want that bottom...

[19:03] Student (Corbin searcy): I didn't answer yet.*
[19:07] Tutor (Marena keys): Okay.*
[19:10] Tutor (Marena keys): Um, so first you kind of want to solve for like the...*
[19:16] Tutor (Marena keys): The horizontal like green piece.*
[19:21] Tutor (Marena keys): Um... so like the side of it, if that makes sense?*
[19:26] Tutor (Marena keys): Not the diagonal but the horizontal.*
[19:29] Student (Corbin searcy): The bottom? The bottom?*
[19:30] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah.*
[19:32] Tutor (Marena keys): And then they're asking for the diagonal now.*
[19:35] Tutor (Marena keys): So then if you solve for the base first, then you can find the diagonal.*
[19:47] Student (Corbin searcy): Okay. So... do I like...*
[19:52] Student (Corbin searcy): Would I find... X Z first?*
[19:55] Tutor (Marena keys): Yes.*
[19:56] Student (Corbin searcy): Okay. So finding X Z... 8 squared plus 12 squared... 208.*
[20:04] Student (Corbin searcy): So X Z is the square root of 208.*
[20:10] Student (Corbin searcy): And then... W Z... 8 squared plus 208... 272.*
[20:17] Student (Corbin searcy): Wait, square root of 272.*
[20:24] Student (Corbin searcy): Wait, is this an 8? I thought that was a W.*
[20:35] Student (Corbin searcy): I got 272. That was the answer.*

[20:44] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah, okay.*
[20:47] Tutor (Marena keys): Um, this one's also like... the same thing, just different numbers.*
[20:52] Student (Corbin searcy): 15 squared plus 15 squared plus 22 squared.*
[20:59] Student (Corbin searcy): 934.*

[21:43] Student (Corbin searcy): What is the length of the new side?*
[22:10] Student (Corbin searcy): Would I do subtraction on this one?*
[22:14] Tutor (Marena keys): Um, this one...*
[22:17] Tutor (Marena keys): Well first you kind of want to solve for like the...*
[22:20] Tutor (Marena keys): The horizontal like green piece.*
[22:23] Tutor (Marena keys): Um, so like the side of it, if that makes sense?*
[22:27] Tutor (Marena keys): Not the... not the diagonal.*
[22:29] Tutor (Marena keys): But the horizontal piece.*
[22:31] Student (Corbin searcy): The bottom? The bottom?*
[22:32] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah.*
[22:33] Tutor (Marena keys): And then they're asking for the diagonal now.*
[22:36] Tutor (Marena keys): So then if you solve for the base first, then you can find the diagonal.*
[22:40] Tutor (Marena keys): But yeah, I think you have to do subtraction.*
[22:42] Student (Corbin searcy): Would the base be 1 or 2?*
[22:44] Tutor (Marena keys): Well it would be... the square root of 9 squared minus 8 squared.*
[23:32] Student (Corbin searcy): Okay so it would be 8 squared...*
[23:36] Student (Corbin searcy): Minus 9 squared...*
[23:38] Tutor (Marena keys): Well no, 9 squared minus 8 squared.*
[23:42] Student (Corbin searcy): Yes.*
[23:43] Tutor (Marena keys): And then the square root of that.*
[23:45] Student (Corbin searcy): I got 17.*
[23:47] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah so that's just the base. But then they want you to find the diagonal now.*
[23:54] Tutor (Marena keys): So now you have uh... 3 squared plus the square root of 17 squared...*
[23:59] Tutor (Marena keys): Which is just 17.*
[24:02] Tutor (Marena keys): So 9 plus 17...*
[24:07] Student (Corbin searcy): 26.*
[24:09] Student (Corbin searcy): Yeah so then it would be the square root of 26 I think.*
[24:12] [mouse click event (24:12-24:13): Corbin selects square root of 26 (target=radio button)]*
[24:13] Student (Corbin searcy): I think that should work.*

[24:15] Student (Corbin searcy): Oh... and Rich. Oh man.*
[25:06] Student (Corbin searcy): What are we solving for?*
[17:38] Student (Corbin searcy): Well, no, nine squared minus eight squared.*
[17:42] Tutor (Marena keys): Yes.*
[17:43] Student (Corbin searcy): And then square root of that.*
[17:45] Student (Corbin searcy): I got seventeen.*
[17:47] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah, so that's the...*
[17:48] Student (Corbin searcy): I got four point... I got four point one.*
[17:51] Tutor (Marena keys): Well don't solve for it yet, but that's just the base, but then they want you to find the diagonal now.*
[17:57] Tutor (Marena keys): So now you have uh, three squared plus the square root of seventeen squared...*
[18:01] Tutor (Marena keys): ...which is just seventeen. So nine plus seventeen.*
[18:08] Student (Corbin searcy): Twenty-six?*
[18:09] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah, so then it'd be the square root of twenty-six I think.*
[18:13] [mouse click event (18:13-18:14):  (target=Radio button for square root of 26)]*

[19:22] Student (Corbin searcy): What? Are you on call?
[19:25] Student (Corbin searcy): Okay, um...

[24:46] Student (Nabetse caro): Um, I can't hear you.
[24:48] Tutor (Marena keys): Oh can you hear me now?
[24:49] Student (Nabetse caro): Oh yeah, oh yeah, I can hear you.
[24:51] Student (Nabetse caro): Um, sorry to bother you but I need help on my MobyMax.
[24:56] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah, okay. Um, yeah it's not bothering me.
[24:58] Tutor (Marena keys): Uh could you share your screen with me?
[25:01] Student (Nabetse caro): Um, how do I do that?
[25:03] Tutor (Marena keys): Uh there should be like a, a green share button at the bottom with like an arrow.

[26:04] Student (Nabetse caro): Yeah, okay.
[26:10] Student (Nabetse caro): Um, instead I did this, I did...
[26:14] Student (Nabetse caro): Oh wait, I might have got it wrong.
[26:16] [app_switch event (26:16-26:17): from=MobyMax/unknown window, to=Desmos/unknown window, details=Student switches tab to Desmos]
[26:17] Student (Nabetse caro): I did this. I minus-ed them.

[26:22] Student (Nabetse caro): And it said to add them, but I don't understand how the question like how I have to add them.
[26:26] Tutor (Marena keys): Oh, um...
[26:28] Tutor (Marena keys): And then round to the nearest... Oh.
[26:31] Student (Nabetse caro): I already got it wrong so that's why it's not showing the question but it was like um, like this. And it was uh...
[26:44] [mouse move event (26:44-26:47):  (target=Student highlights parts of the feedback formula)]
[26:45] Student (Nabetse caro): A be right here and C and C was eight, A was seven, and then B was the missing number.
[26:51] Student (Nabetse caro): But how did they write it? Like was it adding?
[26:57] Student (Nabetse caro): Yeah I'll just try to do this one. Like these.
[26:56] [mouse click event (26:56-26:57):  (target=Next button)]
[26:58] Tutor (Marena keys): Oh okay.
[27:00] Tutor (Marena keys): Um...
[27:48] Tutor (Marena keys): Okay so tell me what you would do for this one.*
[27:51] Student (Nabetse caro): Okay so first I would draw my little triangle. I think.*
[27:54] Tutor (Marena keys): Okay.*
[28:06] Student (Nabetse caro): Uh I would write my triangle.*
[28:08] [drawing event (28:08-28:13): tool=pen, Student draws a right triangle (target=Drawing a triangle on screen)]*
[28:09] Student (Nabetse caro): Oh A is on this side...*
[28:12] Student (Nabetse caro): B's at the bottom and C is the like slanted line.*
[28:15] Student (Nabetse caro): So C's three, A is the missing number and B is two.*
[28:20] Student (Nabetse caro): So I think I would... to find that one... I would subtract? No I would add them, no?*
[28:33] Tutor: Um, this one you would subtract cause like you already given, so you know like A squared plus B squared equals C squared. And you're given B and C. So you want to find A. So you would have to do um, A squared is equal to C squared minus B squared. So you are subtracting.*
[29:29] [app_switch event (29:29-29:30): from=MobyMax/unknown window, to=Desmos/unknown window, details=Student switches tab to Desmos]*
[29:30] Tutor (Marena keys): And then um, from there like take the square root.*
[29:36] [mouse click event (29:36-29:37):  (target=Desmos keypad '3')]*
[29:37] [mouse click event (29:37-29:38):  (target=Desmos keypad 'a^2')]*
[29:38] [mouse click event (29:38-29:39):  (target=Desmos keypad '-')]*
[29:39] [mouse click event (29:39-29:40):  (target=Desmos keypad '2')]*
[29:40] [mouse click event (29:40-29:41):  (target=Desmos keypad 'a^2')]*
[29:41] [mouse click event (29:41-29:42):  (target=Desmos keypad 'enter')]*
[29:42] [mouse click event (29:42-29:43):  (target=Desmos keypad 'sqrt')]*
[29:43] [mouse click event (29:43-29:44):  (target=Desmos keypad '5')]*
[29:41] Student (Nabetse caro): And then I'd get square root of five.*
[29:44] Student (Nabetse caro): Two point two three.*
[29:46] Student (Nabetse caro): And then that's what I was getting wrong earlier is when I was rounding them I wasn't rounding correctly. Which is rounding is a little confusing to me.*
[29:55] Tutor (Marena keys): Oh, okay. What does it want you to round to?*
[29:56] [app_switch event (29:56-29:57): from=Desmos/unknown window, to=MobyMax/unknown window, details=Student switches tab to MobyMax]*
[29:57] Student (Nabetse caro): I got two point two...*
[30:01] Student (Nabetse caro): Two point two, and it doesn't... it says to round to the nearest tenth.*
[30:04] [app_switch event (30:04-30:05): from=MobyMax/unknown window, to=Desmos/unknown window, details=Student switches tab to Desmos]*
[30:06] [app_switch event (30:06-30:07): from=Desmos/unknown window, to=MobyMax/unknown window, details=Student switches tab to MobyMax]*
[30:07] Student (Nabetse caro): So... two point three?*
[30:11] Tutor (Marena keys): No, it would be two point two, only because the next number is three so that just means um... like you just stay the same.*
[30:11] [keyboard type event (30:11-30:12): text '2.2'; ]*
[30:17] Student (Nabetse caro): Like rounding down per se?*
[31:07] Student (Nabetse caro): Oh cause I subtracted, that's why I'm rounding down?*
[31:08] Tutor (Marena keys): No, you don't round down because of subtraction or addition. It's just whatever is the next number. So if you go back to the uh, calculator thing...*
[31:16] [app_switch event (31:16-31:17): from=MobyMax/unknown window, to=Desmos/unknown window, details=Student switches tab to Desmos]*
[31:19] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah, so you have two point two three. Right? So you know like in the tenths place is two. And then in the hundredths place is three.*
[31:28] Student (Nabetse caro): Yeah.*
[31:29] Tutor (Marena keys): So if it's like five or... if it's like five to nine, if the next number is between five and nine, then you would round up.*
[31:38] Tutor (Marena keys): But if the next number is between like zero and four, you just stay the same.*
[31:44] Student (Nabetse caro): Oh okay, okay, okay, yeah. Yeah I get that now.*
[31:47] [app_switch event (31:47-31:48): from=Desmos/unknown window, to=MobyMax/unknown window, details=Student switches tab to MobyMax]*
[31:49] [mouse click event (31:49-31:50):  (target=Next button)]*
[31:50] Student (Nabetse caro): Yeah that should work. Okay.*
[31:52] Student (Nabetse caro): Thank you.*
[31:53] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah of course.*
[32:41] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah, do you have any more questions or was just, was it just that thing?*
[32:44] Student (Nabetse caro): No, my only questions were the rounding part.*
[32:47] Tutor (Marena keys): Oh okay, okay.*
[32:50] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah, was that good? Like did that make sense?*
[32:52] Student (Nabetse caro): Yes, it did. Thank you.*
[32:54] Tutor (Marena keys): Yeah of course.*
[32:57] Tutor (Marena keys): Okay I'm gonna go back to another breakout room now.*
[33:01] Student (Nabetse caro): Oh yeah, okay.*
[33:04] [view_change event (33:04-33:06): Camera switches to tutor view only ]*
[33:07] Tutor (Marena keys): Hi, I'm back again.*
[33:10] Tutor (Marena keys): Uh, could you share your screen with me again so I can see what you're working on?*
