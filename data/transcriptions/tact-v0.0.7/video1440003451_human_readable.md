[08:40] Student (Jumaa): Like, do you mean IXL?*

[12:38] Tutor (Gabby centi): Okay. Yeah, so I guess they also hop off a little bit early.
[12:42] Tutor (Gabby centi): It kind of depends between, um, schools.
[12:49] Tutor (Gabby centi): But yeah, sorry this session is really big for some reason. Um, and so I'm sorry if like the assignments...
[13:01] Tutor (Gabby centi): Because I know most of my... only one of my students in my assigned list were actually present today.
[13:06] Tutor (Gabby centi): Um, so and I know it was hard with like doing the survey and stuff, but next week it should go a little smoother.
[13:53] Tutor (Gabby centi): Um, yeah I think just kind of notes like try to join a few minutes early.
[14:00] Tutor (Gabby centi): Um, especially because these kids did join on time. Some schools they join late.
[14:05] Tutor (Gabby centi): Try to join a little bit early or on time so we can split the breakout rooms accordingly.
[14:09] Tutor (Gabby centi): Um, and then for next week try to set goals with them.
[14:14] Tutor (Gabby centi): I'll reiterate next week, um, but PLUS is really trying to focus on like setting goals this semester and it also like rewards them in the classroom.
[14:22] Tutor (Gabby centi): So that would be great. But does anyone have any feedback from today?
[14:26] Tutor (Joel adebayo): Yeah, um, thanks Gabby. I think for me, so...
[14:30] Tutor (Joel adebayo): I think initially I had seven students and I was about setting goals for one of them and all of a sudden I think my assignment changed and I reduced to four.
[14:41] Tutor (Joel adebayo): Then that particular student I could not find her name on my assignments. Yeah.
[15:29] Tutor (Gabby centi): Yeah, we, um... we had additional tutors join after I had created the lists.*
[15:36] Tutor (Gabby centi): So in order to have everyone with assignments and like keep attendance accurate, I had to like change it which automatically changed it.*
[15:47] Tutor (Gabby centi): Um, so yeah, just kind of hopefully for next week we can all get here like at like 7:37, 7:38.*
[15:57] Tutor (Gabby centi): Um, that will mitigate that issue. But I apologize for that.*
[16:01] Tutor (Joel adebayo): Okay that's fine. Thank you.*
[16:04] Tutor (Jenna zhao): Sorry I have another question. So I wasn't able to join on time because I had like a network issue.*
[16:09] Tutor (Jenna zhao): And when I joined and you assigned me like students, I also... I suddenly got disconnected again.*
[16:15] Tutor (Jenna zhao): And then when I rejoined, I didn't have the co-host access so I wasn't able to go to breakout rooms and I wasn't able to like send chats and anything.*
[16:24] Tutor (Jenna zhao): I'm wondering like how I should do my reflection or should I like talk to the supervisor about this case?*
[17:11] Tutor (Gabby centi): Yeah I would say probably reach out to Alex, um, just as like it was an issue today.*
[17:18] Tutor (Gabby centi): Um, but if that happens again, because I know like once you join the breakout rooms like you can't like chat me specifically I don't think.*
[17:26] Tutor (Gabby centi): You could always just Slack me so I know to come back and add you as co-host again.*
[17:31] Tutor (Jenna zhao): Okay. I did Slack but I think you guys are all busy but okay.*
[17:35] Tutor (Gabby centi): Okay. Okay. Sorry.*
[17:38] Tutor (Alexa rincevage): I was wondering is this group doing goal setting? Because I know in the early session on Tuesday we were told that we weren't going to goal set just because it's the shorter session.*
[17:50] Tutor (Gabby centi): That's a good question. Um, I guess I just assumed because in like obviously PLUS like it says like 'Needs to set goals' for everyone.*
[17:58] Tutor (Gabby centi): Um, but I can definitely double check on that.*
[18:01] Tutor (Gabby centi): Because yeah. But thank you.*
[18:06] Tutor (Joel adebayo): Yeah I think yeah in the earlier session I think I was there, was it on Tuesday? Also yeah. So um, I think what M said was if you could rush it through, that's fine.*
[18:57] Tutor (Joel adebayo): Yeah so for me now I think I did for all of my students that were present today. And that was what we just did today. Yeah.*
[19:06] Tutor (Gabby centi): Yeah typically the first because I know it's supposed to be like kind of like a weekly check-in every other week or like whatever it is but yeah I know it's hard like the time is really short and like it seems kind of unrealistic to like spend one minute with each person setting goals.*
[19:25] Tutor (Gabby centi): Um, so yeah I think if it's... once everyone like has goals set if we're supposed to and I check on that um like then it should go quicker but I know initially it will take a little bit longer. Yeah.*
[19:42] Tutor (Gabby centi): But if no one has anything else, you guys are free to go fill out your reflection forms.*
[19:49] Tutor (Gabby centi): Um, and yeah I think we'll definitely get better as the weeks go on. But thank you for bearing with me this week.*
[20:37] Tutor (Alexa rincevage): Thank you.*
[20:39] Tutor (Joel adebayo): Yeah, bye guys.*
[20:41] Tutor (Jenna zhao): Thank you.*
