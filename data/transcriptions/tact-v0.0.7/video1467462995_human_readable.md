[09:16] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Okay okay listen listen to me Charles. Forget about this question. I will ask you another question. You just tell me the answer of that question, okay? Just forget about this question.
[09:25] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Okay?
[09:27] Student: Okay.
[09:29] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Okay so what is 19 minus 15?
[09:31] [inactivity event (09:31-09:43): Student is distracted by background conversation.]
[09:43] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Uh, can you hear me?
[09:45] Student: Wait, what did you say?
[09:47] Tutor (Aditya shetty): 19 minus 15.
[09:50] Student: 19 minus 15...
[09:52] [inactivity event (09:52-10:22): Student is distracted by background chatter in the classroom.]
[11:02] Student: What did you say? 8 plus 4? It equals 4.
[11:05] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Okay great. 4. You're absolutely right. Now tell me what is 13 minus 10?
[11:13] Student: 10 minus 10?
[11:16] Tutor (Aditya shetty): 13. 13 minus 10.
[11:19] [inactivity event (11:19-11:24): Student calculates silently.]
[11:24] Student: That's 3.
[11:26] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Great. So what is 4 plus 3?
[11:30] Student: 4 plus 3...
[11:38] Student: 7.
[11:39] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Okay great so 7 is your answer to this question. So how we did this was...
[12:23] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Okay so in this question there are two negative numbers and two positive numbers. Tell me what the negative numbers are.
[12:33] Student: Integers.
[12:34] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Sorry?
[12:36] Student: Integers.
[12:37] Tutor (Aditya shetty): No no, in this question, can you see there are four different numbers in this question?
[12:41] Student: Oh, negative 10 and negative 15.
[12:44] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Okay, you're absolutely right. And what are the positive numbers?
[12:48] Student: 19 and 13.
[12:51] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Okay so instead of solving four numbers at once, what we did was we broke this question into two parts. So we subtracted 15 from 19, and 10 from 13.
[13:03] Tutor (Aditya shetty): So as you said the answer is 7, so that's how we got 7. Did you understand?
[13:07] Student: Okay.
[13:08] Tutor (Aditya shetty): Yeah so you can go ahead and... 7, 7, not 4.
