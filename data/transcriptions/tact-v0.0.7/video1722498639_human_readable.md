[01:54] Tutor (Katy jones): And it looks like the system is suggesting that you lower your problems completed to 22 instead of 30. Does that sound okay to you?
[02:03] Student (Darrell buffalo ball): Uh, yeah.
[02:05] Tutor (Katy jones): Yeah? Okay.
[02:07] Student (Darrell buffalo ball): So... Oh, yeah?
[02:11] Tutor (Katy jones): Yeah, so that sounds good to you instead of completing 30 problems completing like 22 instead as your goal?
[02:20] Student (Darrell buffalo ball): Okay. Uh, how much did I complete right now?
[02:23] Tutor (Katy jones): Um, it says 13 problems.
[02:28] Student (Darrell buffalo ball): Okay, so I should slow down?
[02:31] Tutor (Katy jones): No, you should just keep working on your problems. 'Cause your goal was 30, but you achieved 13.

[05:52] Tutor (Katy jones): Hi, how's it going?
[05:59] Tutor (Katy jones): Uh, you're muted right now so I can't hear you right now but...
[06:44] [inactivity event (06:44-06:54): Student gestures]
[06:54] Tutor (Katy jones): There should be kind of like a microphone looking button that says audio. Yeah.
[06:58] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): Um, I'm... I'm stuck.
[07:01] Tutor (Katy jones): You're stuck? Okay. If you could share your screen so I can see what you're working on that'd be helpful.
[07:07] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): Okay.
[07:10] [view_change event (07:10-07:12): Student shares screen showing Moby Max interface ]
[07:12] Tutor (Katy jones): Okay.
[07:13] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): I'm working on this.
[07:27] Tutor (Katy jones): Okay. So... Which... I guess which step in these like how they're showing you how to do it, which step do you get stuck on?
[08:28] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): Uh, like I don't I don't like get it.
[08:32] Tutor (Katy jones): Okay. So for these questions we're supposed to be solving for x. Mhm. So we have 1/2 divided by 1/4 equals x over 1.
[08:45] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): Yeah.*
[08:46] Tutor (Katy jones): So a way that we can solve for that is by cross multiplying. So we would do 1/2 times 1, so that's how they got 1/2 on the left. And then they did 1/4 times x, which is how they got x times 1/4 over on the right.*
[09:06] Tutor (Katy jones): Does that part make sense?*
[09:09] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): No.*
[09:10] Tutor (Katy jones): No? Okay. That's okay. Let me... I don't know if you can see me drawing...*
[09:18] [drawing event (09:18-09:19): tool=shape, Tutor draws a green box (target=green box around the problem)]*
[10:00] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): I was gonna draw... Oh woah.*
[10:03] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): Um... Okay.*
[10:04] [view_change event (10:04-10:05): Student stops screen sharing, returning to gallery view ]*
[10:06] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): There we go.*
[10:09] Tutor (Katy jones): Uh, oh yeah I can draw this way too.*
[10:13] [view_change event (10:13-10:14): Tutor shares whiteboard screen ]*
[10:17] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): Okay.*
[10:19] [drawing event (10:19-10:34): tool=pen, Tutor writes 1/2 over 1/4 = x/1 (target=whiteboard)]*
[10:41] Tutor (Katy jones): So the first thing that they do... So we're trying to solve for x is the goal.*
[10:47] [drawing event (10:47-10:49): tool=pen, Tutor draws red arrows crossing the fractions (target=cross multiplication arrows)]*
[10:48] Tutor (Katy jones): So they multiply these two.*
[10:53] Tutor (Katy jones): And then they multiply these two.*
[10:55] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): Oh, the butterfly method.*
[10:57] Tutor (Katy jones): Okay. Yeah.*
[10:59] Tutor (Katy jones): So whatever is on the top is the side that we go on. So like 1/2 times 1 is 1/2.*
[11:08] [drawing event (11:08-11:12): tool=pen, Tutor writes 1/2 = (target=whiteboard)]*
[11:51] Tutor (Katy jones): And since 1/2 is on the left side of the equal sign, it stays on the left side. And then the x is on the right hand side, so when you're multiplying by 1/4 it'll be...*
[12:03] [drawing event (12:03-12:08): tool=pen, Tutor writes x over 1/4 (looks like x times 1/4 notation) (target=whiteboard)]*
[12:12] Tutor (Katy jones): And then once you have this, what's a way to get x by itself?*
[12:17] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): Um... subtract?*
[12:21] Tutor (Katy jones): So we actually since it's multiplication we want to divide. Oh. But instead of dividing, a different way you can do it is multiply by its opposite.*
[12:34] [drawing event (12:34-12:38): tool=pen, Tutor writes (4/1) next to x*1/4 (target=whiteboard)]*
[13:20] Tutor (Katy jones): So see how 4/1 is the opposite of 1/4?*
[13:23] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): Yeah.*
[13:24] Tutor (Katy jones): So yeah, then we would do that to both sides.*
[13:29] [drawing event (13:29-13:32): tool=pen, Tutor writes (4/1) on the left side (target=whiteboard)]*
[13:32] Student (Taylynn tanewasha): Oh whoops. My bad.*
[13:33] Tutor (Katy jones): You're all good. Wait I can't see over here.*
[13:38] [page_scroll event (13:38-13:39): scroll Whiteboard canvas other, Tutor pans the whiteboard]*
[13:40] Tutor (Katy jones): All right so what is 4/1 times 1/2?*
[13:48] [drawing event (13:48-13:50): tool=pen, Student writes '4', then '1' (target=whiteboard)]*
[13:53] [drawing event (13:53-13:54): tool=eraser, Student erases '1' (target=whiteboard)]*
[14:02] [drawing event (14:02-14:09): tool=pen, Student writes (4/1) 1/2 = 1/4 x (4/1) (target=whiteboard)]*
[08:07] Tutor (Katy jones): or over one*
[08:11] Student (Taylynn): Oh, whoops. My bad.*
[08:13] Tutor (Katy jones): You're all good.*
[08:15] Student (Taylynn): Wait, I can't see over there.*
[08:16] Tutor (Katy jones): Okay.*
[08:18] Tutor (Katy jones): All right, so what is... four over one times one half?*
[08:25] Student (Taylynn): Uh...*
[08:28] Student (Taylynn): One fourth?*
[08:30] Student (Taylynn): Oh wait, what was it again?*
[08:32] Tutor (Katy jones): So we're solving for this one here.*
[08:35] [drawing event: tool=pen, Circles the expression on the left side of the equation (target=equation (4/1)1/2)]*
[08:37] Student (Taylynn): Oh, hold on.*
[08:39] Student (Taylynn): Uh, I can't see.*
[08:41] Tutor (Katy jones): Oh really? Okay. Let me move it over here then.
[08:43] [view_change event: Tutor pans the whiteboard view to the right to find empty space Whiteboard content shifts left]
[08:44] Tutor (Katy jones): We're doing four over one times one over two.
[08:45] [drawing event: tool=pen, Writes '4' then a line underneath (target=Whiteboard)]
[08:47] [drawing event: tool=pen, Writes '1' under the 4, then '1' to the right with line under (target=Whiteboard)]
[08:50] [drawing event: tool=pen, Writes '2' under the 1, completing '4/1 1/2' (target=Whiteboard)]
[08:53] Student (Taylynn): Um...
[09:01] Tutor (Katy jones): So multiplication.
[09:04] Student (Taylynn): Uh...
[09:06] Student (Taylynn): Do we just multiply across?
[09:09] Tutor (Katy jones): Yep.
[09:10] Student (Taylynn): Oh, four over two.
[09:12] Tutor (Katy jones): Yep.
[09:13] Tutor (Katy jones): So then we have four over two equals...
[09:13] [drawing event: tool=pen, Writes '= 4' (target=Whiteboard)]
[09:16] [drawing event: tool=pen, Writes line under 4 and '2' below it (target=Whiteboard)]
[09:21] Tutor (Katy jones): And then what's... um... this one? One fourth times four over one.
[09:25] [view_change event: Tutor pans whiteboard back to the left to show original problem ]
[09:26] [drawing event: tool=pen, Circles the expression on the right side (target=equation 1/4 * (4/1))]
[09:28] Student (Taylynn): Uh... wait, what was it?
[09:30] Tutor (Katy jones): One fourth? So one over four times four over one.
[09:36] Student (Taylynn): Uh, one?
[09:39] Tutor (Katy jones): One? Yeah.
[09:40] [view_change event: Tutor pans whiteboard to the right again ]
[09:41] Tutor (Katy jones): So then we have one x.
[09:42] [drawing event: tool=pen, Writes '1' next to the '=' (target=Whiteboard)]
[09:45] Tutor (Katy jones): So we end our problem with x equaling four over two.
[09:50] Student (Taylynn): Oh.
[09:54] Tutor (Katy jones): So four over two would be the answer or this can also go to two, yeah.
[09:57] [drawing event: tool=pen, Writes '2' below the fraction 4/2 with an arrow pointing down to it (target=Whiteboard)]
[10:00] [drawing event: tool=pen, Writes '= x' next to the 2 (target=Whiteboard)]
[10:03] Student (Taylynn): Wait, but there's a one on the denominator.
[10:09] Tutor (Katy jones): So two is the same thing as two over one.
[10:13] [drawing event: tool=pen, Writes '2' over '1' below the previous answer (target=Whiteboard)]
[10:15] Student (Taylynn): Oh.
[10:18] Tutor (Katy jones): Yeah.
[10:20] Student (Taylynn): Okay, thank you.
[10:22] Tutor (Katy jones): Yeah.
[10:23] [inactivity event (10:23-10:31): No speech or movement on whiteboard]
[10:31] [view_change event: Whiteboard is cleared, showing blank grid ]
[10:37] Tutor (Katy jones): And it looks like you haven't set any goals yet. Um...
[10:41] Student (Taylynn): I was... how do... I don't think I was here.
[10:44] Tutor (Katy jones): Okay, that's okay. Well we can set some goals right now.
[10:47] Student (Taylynn): Okay.
[10:49] Tutor (Katy jones): Um, so the default is to spend 30 minutes in seven days. Does that sound good to you?
[10:54] Student (Taylynn): 30 minutes in seven days? Yeah.
[10:57] Student (Taylynn): Um, sure.
[10:58] Tutor (Katy jones): Okay. And this is just during the tutoring sessions.
[11:02] Tutor (Katy jones): And then for skills completed, does two sound good?
[11:08] Student (Taylynn): Sure.
[11:10] Tutor (Katy jones): Okay. And is there anything that might get in your way? Like getting distracted, not feeling like doing like math, starting late or not understanding the problems?
[11:20] Student (Taylynn): Um, probably just not being here at school. Cause I wasn't here last week.
[11:25] Tutor (Katy jones): Okay.
[11:26] Student (Taylynn): I mean the week before.
[11:28] [inactivity event (11:28-11:47): Silence while tutor presumably logs goals on non-shared screen]
[11:47] Tutor (Katy jones): Okay. Now I just saved your goals and I'll stop the whiteboard so then you can share your math again.
[11:53] Student (Taylynn): Okay.

[12:01] Student (Taylynn): I already did the other one.
[12:04] Tutor (Katy jones): Oh, cool.
[12:07] Student (Taylynn): So... one over three.
[12:09] [mouse move event: Student moves cursor around the fraction 1/3 (target=fraction 1/3)]
[12:14] Tutor (Katy jones): If you haven't done ratios in a while, I can help a little bit.
[12:19] Student (Taylynn): Um, three times... oh, three over nine, right?
[12:25] Tutor (Katy jones): Yeah, so you would have one third over one ninth and then you're cross multiplying both of them.
[12:31] Student (Taylynn): Yeah.
[12:33] Tutor (Katy jones): So you would have one third on one side and then one ninth times x on the other.
[12:39] Student (Taylynn): Yeah. And then I got three over nine.
[12:44] Tutor (Katy jones): That sounds right.
[12:46] Student (Taylynn): Yeah. Then... after that...
[12:58] Student (Taylynn): Equals... that equals x right?
[13:01] Tutor (Katy jones): Yeah.
[13:04] Student (Taylynn): And then do we simplify it?
[13:07] Tutor (Katy jones): What... what number did you get?
[13:10] Student (Taylynn): Three over nine.
[13:12] Tutor (Katy jones): Three over nine? Okay. I got nine over three.
[13:17] Student (Taylynn): Oh.
[13:19] Tutor (Katy jones): Which is close.
[13:20] Student (Taylynn): Oh yeah because...
[13:22] Student (Taylynn): The numerator times the denominator is the numerator? So it'll be nine over three.
[13:31] Tutor (Katy jones): Yeah.
[13:32] Student (Taylynn): Equals x.
[13:43] Student (Taylynn): Do I simplify now?
[13:45] Tutor (Katy jones): Yeah. What did you get?
[13:47] Student (Taylynn): Um, hold on.
[13:47] [keyboard type event: text '3'; Student types '3' into the answer box]
[13:53] Student (Taylynn): One and... one whole... and then I got three.
[14:01] Student (Taylynn): Left over.
[14:05] Tutor (Katy jones): Huh. I got something different.
[14:10] Tutor (Katy jones): Oh, what did you get?
[14:11] Tutor (Katy jones): I got three over one. So i got nine over three and then I simplified it to three over one.
[14:19] Student (Taylynn): Oh, that sounds right.
[14:21] Student (Taylynn): Oh yeah, because there was three left over and then there was one whole.
[14:27] Tutor (Katy jones): Okay.
[14:31] Student (Taylynn): Oh then do I put the three right there?
[14:33] Tutor (Katy jones): Yeah.
[14:34] [mouse click event: Student clicks the green arrow button (target=Next button)]
[14:35] [system event: Correct answer sound and screen transition]
[14:37] Tutor (Katy jones): Cool, nice job.
[14:38] Tutor (Katy jones): I'm gonna go check in on some of your other classmates. Um but keep up the good work with these problems.
[14:44] Student (Taylynn): Okay.
[14:47] [inactivity event (14:47-15:37): Student reads the new problem silently, inactive on screen]
[15:37] Tutor (Katy jones): Hi, how's it going?
[15:41] Student (Taylynn): I'm gonna go ahead and...
[15:43] Tutor (Katy jones): I don't know if you need help or not, but this would help me to kind of set up this problem.
[15:46] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor draws a large dollar sign (target=Moby Max screen)]
[15:52] Tutor (Katy jones): So we're thinking about dollars per hour.
[15:55] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor writes '/ hr' (target=Moby Max screen)]
[16:00] Tutor (Katy jones): So her total dollars is 64.38.
[16:04] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor writes '= 64.38' next to the dollar symbol (target=Moby Max screen)]
[16:13] Tutor (Katy jones): And then divided by the total number of hours that she's worked.
[16:16] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor draws a division line under 64.38 (target=Moby Max screen)]
[16:19] Tutor (Katy jones): So she's worked from 8 to 9, 9 to 10, 10 to 11, 11 to 12, 12 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4.
[16:33] Tutor (Katy jones): Plus... 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour, so plus point two five.
[16:40] Tutor (Katy jones): But then... so that's 8.25 hours she was total at work.
[16:45] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor writes '8.25 at work' at the bottom of the screen (target=Moby Max screen)]
[16:56] Tutor (Katy jones): But she took a 1 hour lunch break.
[17:02] Tutor (Katy jones): So we subtract one hour.
[17:03] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor writes '- 1' below '8.25' (target=Moby Max screen)]
[17:05] Tutor (Katy jones): So then we would have 7.25 hours working.
[17:09] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor writes '7.25' (target=Moby Max screen)]
[17:12] Tutor (Katy jones): And then we can put that up here.
[17:14] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor draws an arrow from 7.25 to the denominator position under 64.38 (target=Moby Max screen)]
[17:19] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor writes '7.25' as the denominator (target=Moby Max screen)]
[17:28] Tutor (Katy jones): And then that would...*
[16:47] [drawing event (16:47-16:58): tool=pen, Student writes '8.25 at wo' below the equation sketch (target=Moby Max workspace)]*
[16:59] Tutor (Katy jones): But she took a 1 hour lunch break for which she did not get paid.*
[17:04] Tutor (Katy jones): So we subtract 1 hour.*
[17:08] [drawing event (17:08-17:10): tool=pen, Tutor writes '7.25' in black ink (target=Workspace below 8.25)]*
[17:14] Tutor (Katy jones): And then we can put that up here.*
[17:23] [drawing event (17:23-17:26): tool=pen, Tutor writes '7.25' under the line where '64.38' is the numerator (target=Denominator of fraction)]
[17:30] Tutor (Katy jones): And then that would be for dollars per hour.
[17:35] [mouse click event (17:35-17:36): Student clicks the text box '$ ___ per hour' (target=Input box for answer)]
[17:40] [inactivity event (17:40-18:13): No on-screen activity or dialogue; student is presumably calculating 64.38 / 7.25]
[18:53] Tutor (Katy jones): And I don't know if you can use like a calculator for this problem cause 64.38 divided by 7.25 is kind of a nasty...
[19:06] Tutor (Katy jones): problem to figure out.
[19:12] Tutor (Katy jones): but we can also go through that if you want to.
[19:17] [keyboard type event (19:17-19:21): text '8.88'; Student types the answer into the box]
[19:23] Tutor (Katy jones): Yeah.
[19:24] [system event (19:24-19:25): Green checkmark appears indicating correct answer]
[19:25] Tutor (Katy jones): Nice.
[19:26] [view_change event (19:26-19:27): Next problem loads: 'Rachel earned $85.25 for working 6 1/4 hours.' ]
[20:15] Tutor (Katy jones): So this same kind of thing we're looking for dollars per hour.

[20:33] [inactivity event (20:33-21:36): No activity on screen. Student is likely working on the problem off-screen.]
[22:16] Tutor (Katy jones): I also want to update your goals when you have a chance.
[22:25] Tutor (Katy jones): Um... I can put the suggestions in the chat and if you just want to react to that...
[22:34] Tutor (Katy jones): if they're good.
[22:36] [app_switch event (22:36-22:38): from=Moby Max/unknown window, to=Zoom/unknown window, details=Student switches to the Zoom browser window, creating an infinite mirror effect on the shared screen.]

[22:42] Tutor (Katy jones): That's a lot of...
[22:43] Tutor (Katy jones): Maybe stop sharing your screen and then reshare to get rid of all of those.
[22:46] [mouse click event (22:46-22:47): Student clicks the red 'Stop Share' button (target=Stop Share button)]

[23:46] Tutor (Katy jones): feel okay for you?
[23:50] Tutor (Katy jones): You can either type in the chat or... Yep. Okay cool.
[23:55] Tutor (Katy jones): And then does changing from two skills per week to one skill per week sound good?
[24:05] Tutor (Katy jones): Yeah? Okay, great.
[24:09] Tutor (Katy jones): Um... Is there anything that might get in your way?
[24:17] Tutor (Katy jones): I'll send them... each of the options individually and then you can like them...
[25:07] Tutor (Katy jones): ...if you think that one sounds the best.

[25:34] Tutor (Katy jones): Um...

[27:32] Tutor (Katy jones): There's three different options to kind of help you get started on math.*

[28:38] Tutor (Katy jones): Or reminding yourself why math will help you.*
[28:42] Tutor (Katy jones): Like your grades or your goals.*
[29:02] Tutor (Katy jones): Taking a short break can also help me get focused again.*

[30:09] Tutor (Katy jones): Here are the options if you want to see them.*
