[00:02] Tutor (Riona duncan): Hey Iyonna, how's it going?
[00:06] Student (Iyonna): Good.
[00:08] [view_change event (00:08-00:10): Student starts screen sharing. Khan Academy window becomes visible. Browser window showing 'Patterns with numbers' exercise.]
[00:10] Tutor (Riona duncan): Awesome. Uh-huh. All right.
[00:13] [mouse move event (00:13-00:14): Cursor moves slightly on the left side of the screen.]
[00:14] Tutor (Riona duncan): So, I just wanted to check in on your goals real quick. Um, we don't have to set anything right now.
[00:21] Tutor (Riona duncan): But um, currently you've got a target of 30 minutes for the next week...
[00:28] Tutor (Riona duncan): Um, and two skills to be... four skills, sorry, to be updated.
[00:31] Tutor (Riona duncan): Sound good?
[00:33] Student (Iyonna): Mhm.
[00:35] Tutor (Riona duncan): All right. Perfect.
[00:38] Tutor (Riona duncan): The following pattern starts with 5 and uses the rule multiply the previous term by 3.
[00:44] [mouse hover event (00:44-00:45): Cursor hovers over the number 5 in the question text. (target=number 5 in text)]
[00:47] [mouse hover event (00:47-00:49): Cursor hovers over 'multiply the previous term by 3'. (target=rule text)]
[00:53] [mouse hover event (00:53-00:55): Cursor moves along the sequence '5, 15, 45, 135, 405'. (target=number sequence)]
[00:58] Tutor (Riona duncan): So, how are you feeling about this kind of question?
[01:03] Student (Iyonna): I don't know, it's confusing.
[01:06] Tutor (Riona duncan): Yeah?
[01:09] Tutor (Riona duncan): All right.
[01:54] Tutor (Riona duncan): So one way that I would look at this is I would just try and find cases that um...
[02:00] Tutor (Riona duncan): mean that the answer couldn't be true.
[02:04] Tutor (Riona duncan): Cause if it's not true then I can move on to the next one.
[02:30] Tutor (Riona duncan): So...
[02:31] Tutor (Riona duncan): for this, I would um, look through and figure out what can... might not be true.
[02:40] [inactivity event (02:40-03:31): Student stares at the screen without moving the cursor; Tutor waits.]

[04:14] [system event (04:14-04:15): Student makes an 'ok' hand sign.]
[04:17] Tutor (Riona duncan): Awesome. Can you share your screen with me so I know what you're working on?

[05:29] [mouse click event (05:29-05:30): Student clicks the X to close the Khanmigo chat window. (target=Khanmigo chat close button)]
[05:52] Tutor (Riona duncan): So, the first step I would take when I was trying to solve this problem would be to substitute in what I know r is and what I know s is.
[07:00] Tutor (Riona duncan): So I would rewrite this as um, 6 times 1/4 plus 14 times 1/4.
[07:19] Tutor (Riona duncan): Also just as a check in on your goals, given I have them up, um...
[07:25] Tutor (Riona duncan): Just so you know, you are killing both of them.
[07:30] Tutor (Riona duncan): Um, yeah.
[08:27] Tutor (Riona duncan): In terms of your goal for time put in, you said you'd do 20 minutes, you did 26... 31.
[08:34] Tutor (Riona duncan): So the recommendation is to do 26 um, minutes as your new goal to put it a little higher cause you went so far past it.
[08:41] Tutor (Riona duncan): Thumbs up? Perfect. All right.
[08:42] [system event (08:42-08:43): Student gives a double thumbs up in the video feed.]
[08:44] Tutor (Riona duncan): I will set that for you.
[08:50] Tutor (Riona duncan): Um, and then you did 12 skills, so the highest this goes is 5.
[08:56] Tutor (Riona duncan): Um, so the recommendation is to keep it up there at 5.
[09:01] Tutor (Riona duncan): Sound decent?
[09:04] [system event (09:04-09:05): Student gestures with a salute/peace sign.]
