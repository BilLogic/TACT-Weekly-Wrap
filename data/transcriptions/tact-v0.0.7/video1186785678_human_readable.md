[13:51] Tutor (Paisley crawford): So from eight to twelve is four hours.
[13:55] Student (Mykael): Yeah.
[13:56] Tutor (Paisley crawford): And then from twelve to four fifteen is another four hours and fifteen minutes.
[14:02] Student (Mykael): So eight hours and fifteen minutes.
[14:05] Tutor (Paisley crawford): Yeah, minus the one hour lunch break.
[14:08] Student (Mykael): Seven hours and fifteen minutes.
[14:10] Tutor (Paisley crawford): Perfect. And fifteen minutes is what as a decimal?
[14:15] Student (Mykael): Um, point one five?
[14:18] Tutor (Paisley crawford): Think of it like a quarter. Like a quarter of an hour.
[14:22] Student (Mykael): Oh, point two five.
