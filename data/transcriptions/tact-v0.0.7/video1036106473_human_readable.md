[00:02] Student (Nainoa): Um, I just guessed.
[00:06] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Well, you're not quite right. So, how about we do it together?
[00:13] Student (Nainoa): Uhh, I suppose.
[00:16] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): I suppose. Alright.
[00:19] Student (Nainoa): Wait no no no wait, I know how to... I think I know how to do this.
[00:22] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay, how?
[00:24] Student (Nainoa): Hold up, I'm working on it, I'm working on it. Four and then two... divided by two divided by two equals...
[00:35] Student (Nainoa): Uh... two four two...
[00:37] Student (Nainoa): and then this one is one... It's two.
[00:39] [keyboard type event (00:39-00:40): text '2'; Student types '2' in the answer box.]
[00:39] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): It is two.

[00:41] [system event (00:41-00:42): Correct answer feedback, loads next problem.]
[00:41] Student (Nainoa): Yes!
[00:44] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So, tell me with words, what are you doing? How did you figure that out?
[00:48] Student (Nainoa): Uh, I did two wait, hold up, I literally just erased it. I did two over...
[00:54] Student (Nainoa): No, wait, I can't remember the numbers. I think it was one over two times and then I flipped it and then I multiplied it and then I got two over one which...
[01:03] Background: ...whole period!
[01:07] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Yeah. Good job.
[01:42] Background: Wait like the whole entire year?
[01:47] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): All right.
[01:50] [keyboard type event (01:50-01:51): text '1'; Student types '1' into the box.]
[01:51] Student (Nainoa): My friend needs help.
[01:52] [keyboard delete event (01:52-01:53): text '1'; Student deletes the '1'.]
[01:53] Background: No I don't.
[01:55] Student (Nainoa): We're on the same question.
[01:57] Student (Nainoa): So she's trying to cheat and get my answers.
[02:00] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Oh no. We can't have any of that.
[02:02] Student (Nainoa): I was just kidding. I was just kidding.
[02:05] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay, how do you do this one though?
[02:08] Student (Nainoa): You do...
[02:09] Background: What's wrong with you?
[02:10] Student (Nainoa): Um... I don't know, maybe um the same thing but with different numbers.
[02:17] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So true, but what exactly is it that you're doing?
[02:22] Student (Nainoa): Um... are you adding, are you subtracting, are you...
[02:27] Student (Nainoa): You're multiplying.
[02:29] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): You're multiplying? What are you multiplying?
[02:33] Student (Nainoa): 300 and 1 1/2. 1 1/2... and...
[03:22] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So you're close. So what does per mean?
[03:26] Student (Nainoa): Per... Multiply!
[03:28] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Not like purr, like...
[03:31] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Like when it says kilometers per hour, does that mean multiplication, division, what does it mean?
[03:37] Student (Nainoa): Mmm... Division.
[03:39] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Good. So...
[03:42] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): What the problem is saying basically is it's saying the Ferrari drove 300 kilometers in one and a half hours.
[03:50] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): And it wants to know what it did in one hour.
[03:55] Student (Nainoa): Oh, okay.
[03:57] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So you're gonna divide those two numbers instead of multiplying.
[04:02] Student (Nainoa): Oh so 300 divided by 1/2?
[04:07] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So it's...
[04:09] Student (Nainoa): One and a half.
[04:11] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): One...
[04:13] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): You got one and then you have another like half.
[04:17] Student (Nainoa): Oh like one and one half?
[04:19] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So like one and one half, yeah.
[05:02] Student (Nainoa): Oh okay.
[05:05] Student (Nainoa): Let me calculate that real quick.
[05:11] Student (Nainoa): Thank you. Okay wait...
[05:13] Student (Nainoa): I'm sorry teacher she is disturbing me in my work space.
[05:18] Background: Yeah you heard her.
[05:20] Student (Nainoa): She admitted it.
[05:22] Student (Nainoa): One... point five right?
[05:24] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Yep. 1.5.
[05:26] Student (Nainoa): 1.5 because the point five is like 5 over 10 right?
[05:39] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Yeah. Or one half.
[05:42] Student (Nainoa): I think I know the answer.
[05:44] [keyboard type event (05:44-05:46): text '200'; Types 200 in the answer box]

[05:52] Student (Nainoa): Yes. I'm a genius.
[05:57] Background: And you're not.
[05:58] Student (Nainoa): Just kidding I'm joking I'm joking you're like the best math person...
[06:43] Student (Nainoa): ...in the school.
[06:46] Student (Nainoa): Um...
[06:48] Student (Nainoa): Now you multiply this one?
[06:51] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): How is this one different than the other one?
[06:54] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Let's think about it.
[06:56] Student (Nainoa): Now you divide it again. Divided by 2 and 1/2 equals...
[07:01] Student (Nainoa): Okay.
[07:05] Student (Nainoa): 3... 300? 35.
[07:10] Student (Nainoa): Hey don't tell her the answer.
[07:12] Background: I didn't tell her the answer.
[07:15] Student (Nainoa): Divided by 2.5.
[07:20] Student (Nainoa): Oh wait wait wait I'm doing that one right now.
[07:24] Student (Nainoa): Um divided by 2.5.
[07:26] Student (Nainoa): 14.
[07:28] [keyboard type event (07:28-07:29): text '14'; Types 14 in the box]
[07:29] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Very good.

[07:31] [system event (07:31-07:32): Loads next problem (Robin cereal).]
[07:33] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So good. All right I think you got the hang of this.
[07:36] Student (Nainoa): Yeah. Me too.
[07:38] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): I'm gonna go bounce around. If you get stuck though just raise your hand in Zoom and I'll circle back.
[08:25] Student (Nainoa): Okay.
[08:27] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): I'll probably check in in a little bit.
[08:28] Student (Nainoa): Okay. My friend kinda needs help.
[08:32] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Alright I'll probably see her in just a second then.*
[08:37] Student (Nainoa): Okay.*
[08:38] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Good job Nainoa.*
[08:39] Student (Nainoa): Thank you.*
[08:44] [view_change event (08:44-08:45): Tutor switches view to Monte's screen. Screen shows a MobyMax video paused.]*
[08:49] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Hey Monte can you hear me okay?*
[09:05] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Hi Monte can you hear me?*
[10:11] [view_change event (10:11-10:12): Tutor switches view to Winola's screen. Showing MobyMax problem (Robin cereal).]*
[10:12] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Hi Winola how's it going?*
[10:15] Student (Winola): Oh hi.*
[10:19] Student (Winola): Good.*
[10:21] [app_switch event (10:21-10:24): from=MobyMax/unknown window, to=Zoom/unknown window, details=Student switches to Zoom tab, a 'Post Attendee' dialog is visible, then switches back to MobyMax.]*
[10:30] [keyboard type event (10:30-10:31): text '1'; Types '1' in the box.]*
[10:39] Student (Winola): I need help.*
[10:42] Student (Winola): Yeah.*
[10:45] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): That's okay let's walk through it together.*
[10:48] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So it says Robin purchased 3 1/2 ounces of whole wheat cereal for $1.40.*
[10:54] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): What is the cost per ounce?*
[10:56] Student (Winola): Okay.*
[10:57] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So... we know it was it cost one dollar and 40 cents for 3 and a half ounces.*
[11:46] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): And it wants to know how much it's gonna cost...*
[11:49] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): ...for one ounce.*
[11:51] Student (Winola): Okay.*
[11:52] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So what were you doing for the problems you were working on before?*
[11:57] Student (Winola): Um... I divided.*
[12:02] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay.*
[12:03] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So... just keep in mind that you can only just divide the two numbers they give you when it wants to know... um what's the cost per one of something. So like if it's per one hour per one ounce per one minute...*
[12:19] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Whatever that bottom...*
[12:22] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): ...number is it has to be one.*
[12:25] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So if we stick with dividing like we have been...*
[12:29] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): ...then you could do...*
[12:31] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): ...it's if it's 1.4...*
[12:34] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): ...for every 3 and a half ounces...*
[12:38] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): ...what numbers would you divide?*
[13:24] Student (Winola): Um... Three... three and a half and 1.40.*
[13:30] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay which one goes on top? Which one goes first?*
[13:34] Student (Winola): Um 1.40.*
[13:36] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Yeah good job.*
[07:48] [view_change event (07:48-07:48): Initial view of the student's screen sharing MobyMax math problem. Problem: Robin purchased 3 1/2 ounces of whole wheat cereal for $1.40. What is the cost per ounce?]*
[07:49] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Then you could do... It's if it's 1.40 for every 3 and a half ounces, what numbers would you divide?*
[07:59] Student (Winola): Um... three... three and a half and 1.40?*
[08:10] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay, which one goes on top? Which one goes first?*
[08:12] Student (Winola): Um, 1.40.*
[08:14] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Yeah, good job.*
[08:16] [inactivity event (08:16-08:28): Student looks around the classroom and moves cursor idly.]*
[08:28] [mouse click event (08:28-08:29): Student clicks the blue play button icon in the center of the problem area. (target=Play Audio Button)]*
[08:29] [inactivity event (08:29-08:43): Student looks down at desk/paper while audio plays (inaudible in recording).]*
[08:43] Student (Winola): Wait, I have to do it on here?
[08:47] Student (Winola): One... 1.40...
[09:34] Student (Winola): Divided by...
[09:37] Student (Winola): Three...
[09:49] Student (Winola): Wait, what do I turn the 3 and a half into?
[09:59] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So, what is... let's think about it. What's one half in a decimal?
[10:07] Student (Winola): Um... five.
[10:12] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Five what?
[10:13] Student (Winola): Fifty.
[10:15] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Kind of. So it's... the tenths place, right?
[10:23] Student (Winola): Yeah.
[10:24] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So we could say it's 5 over 10.
[10:28] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Right?
[11:12] Student (Winola): 5 over 10?
[11:16] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Or 50 over 100, right?
[11:21] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So it would be 0.5, right?
[11:25] Student (Winola): Yes.
[11:28] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Because 5 tenths is the same thing as 0.5.
[11:33] Student (Winola): So 0.5?
[11:37] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): 0.5. But you have that 3 on there so it's gonna be 3.5.
[11:45] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): One half is the same thing as 0.5.
[11:50] Student (Winola): One half... is the same as 3 point... oh, now I get it.
[11:54] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): There it goes.
[11:56] [inactivity event (11:56-12:21): Student calculates silently, writing on paper or using a calculator.]
[13:01] Student (Winola): Um... three point...
[13:06] Student (Winola): I got 0.4.
[13:08] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Good.
[13:09] Student (Winola): Okay.

[13:19] Student (Winola): I got it right the first time but I was scared to ask.
[13:24] Student (Winola): John purchased 1/4 lbs of hamburger for $0.75. How much did the hamburger cost per pound?
[13:38] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Very nice.
[13:40] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So what are we going to do for this one?
[13:43] Student (Winola): Divide... or times?
[13:45] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Still division. You were right the first time.
[14:31] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay, what are we dividing?
[14:34] Student (Winola): Um... four... wait. One and 75?
[14:40] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): One and 75.
[14:43] Student (Winola): Where did you get those numbers?
[14:50] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Or 4 and 75?
[14:53] Student (Winola): Did you answer?
[14:55] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay, which one goes first?
[14:58] Student (Winola): 75.
[14:59] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Good. How do you know that?
[15:04] Student (Winola): Cause I'm smart.
[15:05] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): True. How else did you know that?
[15:08] Student (Winola): Cause it has a decimal.
[15:12] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay. So another way that we can know that is we look at how it wants the answer. So for the answer, it's money per pound. So we're gonna put money first, divided by the pounds.
[16:14] Student (Winola): It's three dollars.
[16:18] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Sounds about right.
[16:20] Student (Winola): Okay.

[21:37] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Alright, now can you see it?
[21:40] Student (Montay): Uh, yeah.
[21:41] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay. Awesome. So this is the problem they had.
[21:51] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So, what it's doing is what's called a proportion or a ratio.
[21:58] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay? So we're gonna solve this with cross product or cross multiplication. Do you know what that is?
[22:05] Student (Montay): Uh, no.
[22:07] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay. So I'm gonna walk through it. So...
[22:10] [drawing event (22:10-22:12): tool=pen, Tutor draws a large bracket to the left of the equation. (target=Bracket)]
[22:12] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Well there's two ways you can do this. Um, if the problem looks like this...
[22:55] [drawing event (22:55-22:56): tool=highlighter, Tutor highlights the number 1 in the denominator of the answer box. (target=Number 1)]
[22:56] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): ...and there's a one over here, which there is in this case...
[23:00] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): All you have to do is divide these two numbers.
[23:02] [drawing event (23:02-23:04): tool=pen, Tutor draws a bracket grouping 1/2 and 1/10. (target=Fraction stack)]
[23:06] [drawing event (23:06-23:09): tool=pen, Tutor writes '1/2 / 1/10' horizontally. (target=Horizontal division equation)]
[23:07] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So you... all you have to do is do one half divided by one over ten.
[23:12] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Do you remember how to divide these?
[23:15] Student (Montay): Wait... the screen went black hold on.
[23:18] Background (Teacher (lopez)): Okay, why are you not sharing your screen? And why are you...
[23:22] Student (Montay): It's gone black.
[23:27] Student (Montay): It's... I think I messed up.
[23:30] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Can you see, Montay?
[23:36] Student (Montay): No.
[23:38] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay, so you might have to stop sharing your screen in order to see mine.
[23:42] Student (Montay): Oh, I think I did that.
[23:50] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Do you remember how to share?
[23:52] Student (Montay): Alright, I think it's... [unintelligible]... 60 miles per hour.
[24:37] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Let me know when you can see my screen again.
[24:39] Student (Montay): Okay I can see your screen.
[24:40] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Cool. Okay.
[24:42] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So, since there's a one on the bottom over here...
[24:45] [mouse move event (24:45-24:46): Tutor hovers cursor over the 1 in the denominator. (target=Denominator 1)]
[24:47] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): ...on the bottom of what we don't know...
[24:48] [drawing event (24:48-24:49): tool=pen, Tutor draws a box around the denominator 1 again. (target=Box around 1)]
[24:49] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): ...so this might be a question mark or they might put a variable, which would be like a letter like x.
[24:54] [drawing event (24:54-24:56): tool=pen, Tutor draws a box with 'x' inside above a line and '1'. (target=Variable x)]
[24:57] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Um, but since there's a one on the bottom...
[25:01] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): ...of the... in the denominator of the number we don't know, we can just divide these two.
[25:04] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay? So this is the same thing as this. It's just written out a different way. Does that make sense?
[25:06] [drawing event (25:06-25:08): tool=pen, Tutor draws a curved arrow connecting the vertical fraction stack to the horizontal division equation. (target=Arrow connecting equations)]
[25:11] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So how do we do this? How do we divide fractions?
[25:14] Student (Montay): Um... I don't know.
[25:18] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay. So we use what's called copy dot flip.
[25:21] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay? So what that means is we're gonna copy this first number here.
[25:25] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): We're gonna copy it down.
[25:26] [drawing event (25:26-25:28): tool=pen, Tutor draws a red arrow down from the first '1/2' and writes '1/2' below it. (target=Arrow and 1/2)]
[25:29] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): We're gonna write one half again.
[25:31] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): We're gonna turn this division...*
[25:33] [drawing event (25:33-25:36): tool=pen, Tutor draws a squiggly red arrow from the division sign. (target=Division symbol transformation)]*
[26:14] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): ...into multiplication.*
[26:15] [drawing event (26:15-26:16): tool=pen, Tutor draws a multiplication dot. (target=Multiplication dot)]*
[26:16] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Which is where the dot comes in.*
[26:20] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): And then we're gonna flip this fraction.*
[26:22] [drawing event (26:22-26:24): tool=pen, Tutor draws a curved red arrow from '1/10' indicating a flip. (target=Flip arrow)]*
[26:24] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So... we're gonna flip it upside down.*
[26:28] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): And it's gonna be... instead of one over ten, we're gonna make it ten over one.*
[26:31] [drawing event (26:31-26:33): tool=pen, Tutor writes '10/1'. (target=Fraction 10/1)]*
[26:32] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): This is multiplication.*
[26:33] [drawing event (26:33-26:34): tool=pen, Tutor draws an 'x' multiplication sign over the dot. (target=Multiplication sign)]*
[26:36] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So whenever you see two fractions being divided...*
[26:39] [drawing event (26:39-26:42): tool=pen, Tutor writes 'x/y / x/y' as an example. (target=General fraction formula)]*
[26:40] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So something over something divided by something else over something else.*
[26:43] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): You're gonna do copy dot flip. Okay?*
[26:46] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So it's gonna be copy... do the multiplication... and then flip.*
[26:49] [drawing event (26:49-26:51): tool=pen, Tutor writes 'x/y • y/x'. (target=General formula result)]*
[26:51] [drawing event (26:51-26:52): tool=pen, Tutor draws a dotted circle around the general formula. (target=Circle around formula)]*
[26:53] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So, for this, now we can just solve this like we multiply fractions normally.*
[26:57] [mouse move event (26:57-26:58): Tutor indicates the '1/2 * 10/1' equation. (target=Equation 1/2 * 10/1)]*
[26:58] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): One half times ten over one.*
[27:01] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So do you know how to solve this?*
[27:03] Student (Montay): One half, ten over one. Um...*
[27:07] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): We just multiply the top row across, right?*
[27:07] [drawing event (27:07-27:09): tool=pen, Tutor draws an arrow across the numerators. (target=Top row arrow)]*
[27:10] Student (Montay): Yeah.*
[27:11] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So what's one times ten?*
[27:13] Student (Montay): Ten.*
[27:14] [drawing event (27:14-27:15): tool=pen, Tutor writes '10' in the numerator of the result. (target=Result 10)]*
[27:15] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): And then what's two times one?*
[27:16] Student (Montay): Two.*
[27:17] [drawing event (27:17-27:18): tool=pen, Tutor writes '2' in the denominator. (target=Result 2)]*
[27:18] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Good.*
[27:19] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So we have ten over two. What... what... can we simplify this at all?*
[27:56] [drawing event (27:56-27:58): tool=pen, Tutor writes '10/2' below. (target=Fraction 10/2)]*
[28:04] Student (Montay): Uh...*
[28:07] Student (Montay): Yeah.*
[28:08] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay, to what?*
[28:09] Student (Montay): Five one.*
[28:11] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Yep.*
[28:11] [drawing event (28:11-28:12): tool=pen, Tutor writes '= 5/1'. (target=Result 5/1)]*
[28:13] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Or just...*
[28:14] [drawing event (28:14-28:15): tool=pen, Tutor writes '= 5'. (target=Result 5)]*
[28:15] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): The same thing as five.*
[28:16] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So our answer is five for this one. Okay?*
[28:16] [drawing event (28:16-28:17): tool=pen, Tutor circles the answer '5'. (target=Circle 5)]*
[28:20] Student (Montay): Okay.*
[28:21] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Alright.*
[28:23] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Nice job.*
[28:25] [system event (28:25-28:25): Tutoring session ends; screen share stops.]*
[28:28] [view_change event (28:28-28:28): Video cuts to Tutor Kristen Lamberton providing post-session feedback. ]*
[28:29] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay, so that session went pretty well.*
[30:06] [view_change event (30:06-30:06): Video cuts to Nitya Kasera providing feedback. ]*
[30:06] Background (Nitya kasera): It was difficult to keep their attention, but then it was good.*

[30:11] Background (Kylie wang): How was it for you, Kristen?*
[30:14] [view_change event (30:14-30:14): Video cuts back to Kristen Lamberton. ]*
[30:14] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): It was good. Uh, there's one student who I can't seem to get to respond at all.*
[30:21] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Um, but hopefully that'll just take another session to work out.*
[31:21] [view_change event (31:21-31:21): Video cuts to Kylie Wang. ]*
[31:21] Background (Kylie wang): Okay, how was the session for you, Ritvik?*
