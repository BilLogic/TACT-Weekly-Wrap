[12:17] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay.*
[12:19] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So...*
[12:20] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): It drove 300 kilometers in one and a half hours right? You said that was 90.*
[12:27] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): What, what did you mean when you said 90?*
[12:30] Student (Winola): Um because it says one and a half.*
[12:33] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): One and a half hours right? So it's 90 what?*

[13:41] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): We want to know how fast it drove per hour, right?*
[13:44] Student (Winola): Yep.*
[13:46] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay so we want to keep the same unit time on the bottom.*
[13:51] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So because it already gave it to us as...*
[13:55] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Hours, we can keep it as hours. So we can say one and a half hours.*
[14:00] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So we could say 300 kilometers over 1.5 hours.*
[14:06] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Does that make sense?*
[14:07] Student (Winola): Okay.*
[14:08] Student (Winola): Yeah.*
[14:11] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): You could turn it into minutes if you wanted to but then we'd have to go back to hours.*
[14:16] Student (Winola): Okay.*
[14:18] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay so if you have 300 over 1.5. Have you guys learned how to divide decimals yet?*
[15:05] Student (Winola): Um yeah.*
[15:07] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Okay.*
[15:08] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): So if you divide 300 by 1.5 what does that get you?*
[15:13] Background: 300 divided by 1.5. That's a lot.*
[15:16] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): Write it out on your whiteboard.*
[15:18] Student (Winola): Okay.*
[15:23] Background: 300 divided by... 1.5. I have a teacher!*
[15:27] Tutor (Kristen lamberton): That'll give you your answer, okay?*
[15:31] Student (Winola): Okay.*
