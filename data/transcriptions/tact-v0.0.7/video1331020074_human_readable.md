[07:04] Student (Diontai): Yeah I know how to do it.
[07:07] Tutor (Victor miene): Uh let me... let me see. Cause...
[07:09] Tutor (Victor miene): Let me see what your answer is.
[07:13] [app_switch event (07:13-07:14): from=Zoom/unknown window, to=Chrome/Khan Academy, details=Switch back to Khan Academy.]
[07:14] [mouse drag event (07:14-07:17): Student highlights the text 'Look at the number line below. What point is marked on the number line?' (target=problem text)]
[07:19] [keyboard type event (07:19-07:20): Opens a new tab (Ctrl+T).]
[07:23] [mouse click event (07:23-07:24): Clicks back to the Khan Academy tab. (target=tab)]
[07:27] Student (Diontai): So if that is zero... then negative...
[07:27] [mouse hover event (07:27-07:30): Moves cursor over the tick marks on the number line between -1 and 0. (target=number line)]
[07:30] [keyboard type event (07:30-07:34): text '-1/1'; Types '-1/1' again.]
[07:36] [mouse click event (07:36-07:37): Clicks Check. Result: 'Not quite yet...'. (target=Check button)]
[07:39] Tutor (Victor miene): Um, so... um it's okay if you... you're not getting it right at first.
[08:25] Tutor (Victor miene): What you need to know, you can check from zero. From zero to one, they are like... you can count the number of... vertical lines there are.
[08:33] Student (Diontai): One, two, three, four, five, six.
[08:33] [mouse hover event (08:33-08:37): Moves cursor along the tick marks from 0 to 1, counting them. (target=tick marks)]
[08:38] Tutor (Victor miene): Yeah, so you see that there are six.
[08:41] Tutor (Victor miene): And the width of... the... the line from zero to one is like... one.
[08:50] Tutor (Victor miene): Um, so you have to divide one by six places.*
[08:55] Student (Diontai): Five?*
[08:56] Tutor (Victor miene): If you divide one by six... no it's six, not five. I thought it was five too but when I counted it, it was six.*
[09:05] Tutor (Victor miene): So... when you divide one by six places you get... 0.16666... that's like 0.167.*
[09:13] Tutor (Victor miene): So for every time you move... to the left or to the right, you are going to be adding either positive 0.16 or negative 0.16.*
[10:06] Tutor (Victor miene): In this case you are moving to the left... from negative one. So you're supposed to have negative one...*
[10:18] [keyboard type event (10:18-10:20): text '-0/16'; Student types '-0/16'.]*
[10:20] Tutor (Victor miene): And they said your answer should be a fraction. So that's something else.*
[10:29] Tutor (Victor miene): Your answer should be a fraction, so anytime you move to the left you're supposed to have one over six... minus one over six instead of 0.16.*
[10:42] Tutor (Victor miene): So for this one, you have negative one... since you were on negative one.*
[10:48] [keyboard type event (10:48-10:51): text '-0/1'; Student clears field and types '-0/1'.]*
[10:53] Tutor (Victor miene): Instead of zero, you can remove the zero.*
[10:56] Tutor (Victor miene): Can you hear me Diontai?*
[10:58] Student (Diontai): Yeah I can hear you.*
[11:40] Tutor (Victor miene): Uh, okay. So, what I'm saying is that you were at negative one and you're moving to the left. So you're supposed to add... for every time you go to the left you're supposed to add like a negative one over six.*
[11:53] [keyboard type event (11:53-11:55): text '0/1'; Student types '0/1'.]*
[11:58] Tutor (Victor miene): Oh, no no no no. That's still not it.*
[12:03] Tutor (Victor miene): Let me... let me see if I can pull up my whiteboard.*
[12:08] [view_change event (12:08-12:09): Screen share changes. Tutor shares a white screen (whiteboard). ]*
[12:10] Tutor (Victor miene): Can you see my whiteboard?*
[12:13] Student (Diontai): Yes.*
[12:15] [drawing event (12:15-12:30): tool=pen, Tutor draws a horizontal line segment, adds marks for '-1' and writes '-1/6' (or similar math notation). (target=whiteboard)]*
[12:33] Tutor (Victor miene): It's going to give you negative one... then one by six.*
[12:35] [drawing event (12:35-12:37): tool=pen, Tutor writes '-1 1/6'. (target=whiteboard)]*
[13:22] Tutor (Victor miene): Yeah. So this is how it works.*
[13:28] Tutor (Victor miene): Each movement is worth one over six... in this case.*
[13:34] Student (Diontai): Do you want to... try that out?*
[13:40] Student (Diontai): Why the breakout rooms closing already?*
[13:43] Tutor (Victor miene): Do you guys have to leave?*
[13:45] Background: A B C D E F G...*
[13:53] [system event (13:53-13:54): Breakout room closes or session ends.]*
