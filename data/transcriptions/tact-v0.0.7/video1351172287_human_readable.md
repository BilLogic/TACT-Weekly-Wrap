[05:25] Tutor (Alicia chen): Can you walk me through your process on what you're working on?
[05:30] Tutor (Alicia chen): Like how you're solving these?
[05:34] Student (Dewayne austin): Uh, I'm doing all the problems in my head and then I try them out, see if they work or not.
[05:40] Tutor (Alicia chen): And then... yeah.
[05:42] Tutor (Alicia chen): I see.
[05:44] Tutor (Alicia chen): So for example for the first one, what are you thinking?
[05:49] Student (Dewayne austin): That is... that is not three to the second power, that's two to the third power.
[05:53] Tutor (Alicia chen): Mm-hm.
[05:54] Tutor (Alicia chen): That's good.
[05:55] Tutor (Alicia chen): Good job.
[05:57] Tutor (Alicia chen): What about the next one?

[06:41] [mouse click event (06:41-06:42):  (target=Check again button)]
[06:44] Tutor (Alicia chen): I think if you worked through them one by one, you'll be able to find the answer.

[06:57] [mouse click event (06:57-06:58):  (target=Check again button)]
[07:16] Tutor (Alicia chen): Like what... when you look at the second one, what are you thinking?
[07:20] Tutor (Alicia chen): Like if we expand three to the second power, what is that?
[07:24] Student (Dewayne austin): Three times three.
[07:26] Tutor (Alicia chen): Right.
[07:27] Tutor (Alicia chen): So it's not equal to three times two, right?
[07:31] Student (Dewayne austin): That's false.
[07:33] [mouse click event (07:33-07:34):  (target=False option for 3^2 = 3x2)]
[07:34] Tutor (Alicia chen): And then for the second one... three squared is also three times three. Is that equal to three plus three?
[07:35] [mouse click event (07:35-07:36):  (target=False option for 3^2 = 3+3)]
[07:36] [mouse click event (07:36-07:37):  (target=Check again button)]
[08:19] Tutor (Alicia chen): Or the third one, sorry.
[08:20] Student (Dewayne austin): No, that's not me.
[08:24] Tutor (Alicia chen): Nice job.

[11:00] Student (Jordan payne): is...
[11:07] Student (Jordan payne): 2... 5...
[11:13] Student (Jordan payne): I need...
[11:16] Student (Jordan payne): I messed the calculator up.

[12:03] Student (Jordan payne): Is it... 2 and 5?
[12:06] Student (Jordan payne): Is...
[12:14] Tutor (Alicia chen): It wants you to give the answer in the form of a fraction.
[12:19] Tutor (Alicia chen): So you don't actually have to solve like 2 over 5.
[12:22] Tutor (Alicia chen): But what do you think you can do instead?
[12:25] Student (Jordan payne): Uh...
[12:29] Student (Jordan payne): I could split it...
[12:33] Student (Jordan payne): Into...
[12:35] Student (Jordan payne): 2 plus... wait, 2 over 5 plus 2 over 5?
[12:42] Tutor (Alicia chen): Is that what the squared means?
[12:45] Tutor (Alicia chen): Like what does the exponent 2 on the outside mean?
[12:49] Student (Jordan payne): The exponent?
[12:52] Tutor (Alicia chen): Yeah.
[12:55] Student (Jordan payne): I don't know what that is.
[12:56] Tutor (Alicia chen): Do you know what it mean?
[12:58] Student (Jordan payne): No, I don't know what an exponent mean.
[13:01] Tutor (Alicia chen): Okay.
[13:03] Tutor (Alicia chen): Do you know what I'm talking about when I say exponent?
[13:45] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor draws a red circle around the exponent 2 on the screen. (target=the number 2 exponent)]

[13:51] Tutor (Alicia chen): Do you see my annotations?
[13:52] Tutor (Alicia chen): Do you see the circle?
[13:54] Student (Jordan payne): Uh... let me check my phone.
[13:56] Tutor (Alicia chen): I think it shows up on your screen.

[15:19] [view_change event: Stop Share The screen share stops briefly or video cuts to tutor/student view.]
[15:23] Tutor (Alicia chen): Uh, I guess if you just go to the Zoom screen and then I will annotate it there.
[15:24] [system event: Screen share resumes]
[15:34] Tutor (Alicia chen): And hopefully it's not too distracting.
[15:37] Tutor (Alicia chen): Oh, that's kind of distracting. Okay.
[15:41] Tutor (Alicia chen): So, can you see up here?
[15:42] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor draws a red circle in the top right area of the Zoom window. (target=Top right of screen)]
[15:43] Tutor (Alicia chen): See up here.
[15:45] Tutor (Alicia chen): So, you have...
[15:48] Tutor (Alicia chen): When you have an exponent, so you have a number like 5 to the power of 3.
[15:50] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor writes '5^3' in red. (target=Empty space)]
[15:53] Tutor (Alicia chen): This 3 is the exponent.
[15:54] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor circles the '3'. (target=Exponent 3)]
[15:55] Tutor (Alicia chen): And basically what it means is you multiply this base, this number is the base.
[15:58] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor circles the '5'. (target=Base 5)]
[16:00] Tutor (Alicia chen): And you multiply that this many times.
[16:04] Tutor (Alicia chen): So when you have 5 to the power of 3, what you want to do is 5 times 5 times 5.
[16:07] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor writes '5 x 5 x 5'. (target=Equation)]
[16:13] Tutor (Alicia chen): Does that make sense?
[16:14] Student (Jordan payne): Yeah.
[16:16] Tutor (Alicia chen): So when you have like 2 over 5 to the power of 2, then what are you multiplying?
[16:23] [drawing event: tool=pen, Tutor writes '(2/5)^2'. (target=Fraction problem)]
[17:04] Student (Jordan payne): Two... power of... two.
[17:06] Student (Jordan payne): You multiply 2 times 2.
[17:10] Tutor (Alicia chen): Can you say that again? Sorry, I didn't hear you.
[17:13] Student (Jordan payne): 2 times 2.
[17:15] Tutor (Alicia chen): Yeah. And then what about the 5?
[17:19] Student (Jordan payne): Uh, 5 times 5.
[17:22] Tutor (Alicia chen): Yeah, exactly.
[17:24] Tutor (Alicia chen): So if you want to go back to Khan Academy.
[17:28] [app_switch event: from=unknown app/unknown window, to=Chrome/Khan Academy, details=Student switches back to the Khan Academy tab.]
[17:29] Tutor (Alicia chen): So basically the numerator is 2 times 2 and then the denominator is 5 times 5.
[17:34] Tutor (Alicia chen): Can you do that in your head?
[17:36] Student (Jordan payne): Yeah.
[17:45] Student (Jordan payne): I really don't...
[17:48] Student (Jordan payne): What?
[17:49] Student (Jordan payne): 15?
[17:51] Tutor (Alicia chen): Oh, sorry.
[17:55] Tutor (Alicia chen): So, uh, when you're doing fractions, you don't want to add them together.
[18:00] Tutor (Alicia chen): You want to keep the, what's on the top on the top and what's on the bottom on the bottom.
[18:04] Tutor (Alicia chen): So the numerator would be 2 times 2 which is 4, right?*
[18:43] [keyboard type event: text '2'; Student types '2' in the input field.]*
[18:46] Tutor (Alicia chen): And then that would be 4 over...*
[18:49] [keyboard type event: text 'x2 5x5'; Student types 'x2 5x5' making the input '2x2 5x5'.]*
[18:51] Tutor (Alicia chen): Uh, 5 times 5, which is 25.*
[18:57] Tutor (Alicia chen): Yeah. And then you want to simplify that.*
[19:03] Tutor (Alicia chen): Like let's...*
[19:06] Tutor (Alicia chen): Well, you want to simplify that. So...*
[19:12] Student (Jordan payne): So I put... 4?*
[19:15] Tutor (Alicia chen): Yeah.*
[19:16] Tutor (Alicia chen): So you would have 4 over 5.*
[19:21] [keyboard type event: text '4'; Student deletes previous input and types '4'.]*

[21:16] Student (Jordan payne): But you gonna keep the, um, little decimal right here.*
[21:59] Tutor (Alicia chen): Yeah.*
